# Film Leader

Film Photography Companion Application made for Champlain College Capstone.

## About

This project is a photography app that allows users to get recommended film camera settings based off of their surroundings. The app prompts beginners for what they would like their photo to look like as well as the type of film they are using for their camera. After selections are made and a photo is taken on the phone for the light meter to give a result, the app calculates what settings would be best for the film camera.

## How to Run
Testing was done using an emulator on Android Studio as well as downloading the APK onto a physical Google Pixel.
